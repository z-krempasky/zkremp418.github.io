        <h1 id="me">About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Zachary Krempasky, a senior Computer Engineering major at Ohio Northern University. With just a couple classes left in the spring semester I plan on graduating in
            May 2024. Most of the coursework that I have completed up to this point has given me the foundational knowledge I need in order to be successful in a early career opportunity.
            I used the electives in my coursework to increase my knowledge in the computer science industry beyond the typical computer engineering path.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I am also a student-athlete at Ohio Northern University, which has required me to balance both course work and lacrosse, greatly improving my time management skills.
            I have also had the opportunity to advance my leadership and communication skills by taking on additional team responsibilites. As a member of the leadership council for
            three years, I had to communicate efficiently with my teammates and coaching staff on and off the field.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            My previous work experience includes an internship with WaveLynx Technologies, one of the leading companies in access control. As a computer engineering intern on their team I worked closely with the 
            production team in order to improve the quality of life on the production floor. The first project I took on was utilizing C/C++ in the the Arduino IDE to add a led function 
            to the current programming fixture, letting workers know when the device was done. I then took on the task of utilizing breakpoint analysis in their python scripts in order
            to optimize the timing of programming the readers. Throughout my internship I also ran information technology help and resolved various IT related problems such as setting up a 
            Google Meet hardware kit and troubleshooting broken or down computers. The company purchased an adjacent office building while I was there so I helped extend the wireless network
            to the new building(installed and configured a new switch to work with the current network)
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Before my internship at WaveLynx I worked in the restaurant industry for over five years. Working in such a fast paced environment taught me the ability to remain calm and collected
            during times of stress or adveristy. My strong work ehtic and desire to learn more/improve my skill set allowed me to advance from a dishwasher and busboy, up to a cook.

                <p>
                    I have utilized C++ throughout my coursework at Ohio Northern University and I also plan on being a TA for programming in C++ this upcoming semester.
                    I also used it during my internship with WaveLynx.

                <p>
                    Most of my experience with Python comes from my internship with WaveLynx. I had to use it to write new and edit current test scripts
                </p>

                <h2>Level: Competent</h2>
                <p>
                    I used a linux operating system for the entirety of my internship since some of their systems were solely linux based.

                    I have used both Github and Gitlab when working on team projects. For my capstone project we are currently using Github in order to make changes to the application
                    that we are developing. During my internship I utilized Gitlab since that is where WaveLynx keeps a lot of their work.
